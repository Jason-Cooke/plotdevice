    <p>Repetition is what computers are really good at; they never grow bored, you can ask them to
    do the same thing over and over again and they will never stop liking it. And they’re fast at
    calculating too.</p>
    <p>This is the main advantage of software such as PlotDevice, you don’t have to do everything
    by yourself again and again - <strong>once you get the first time right, just let the computer
    handle the hundred other times</strong>.</p>
    <h2>The for-loop</h2>

    <p>In programming terms, repetition, or doing the same thing multiple times, is generally
    called a <em>for-loop</em>. A for-loop is like a set of hands counting fingers. But an infinite
    number of hands, with an infinite number of fingers to count.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="media"><img alt="" height="511" src="../etc/tut/repetition1.jpg" width="584"/></span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The statement looks like this:</p>
<pre>
<span class="k">for</span> variable <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">list</span>:
  do stuff
</pre>

    <p>Don’t forget the little <strong>colon at the end</strong> of the <em>for variable in
    list:</em> statement!</p>
    <h2>The <em>variable</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>variable</em> can have any name you like (you already knew if you read about
    <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>). This variable holds the current count of fingers. A
    common name for it is <em>i</em>, a residue of basic math where counters are generally named
    <em>i</em> as well.</p>
    <p>It’s short, and it’s a good convention with a long history.</p>
    <h2>The <em>list</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>list</em> part is a <a href="Lists.html">list</a> of numbers or elements, of which
    each element is consecutively assigned to the <em>variable</em>. A for-loop doesn’t just count
    fingers, it can count anhything you like, anything you put inside the list: numbers, <a href="Strings.html">strings</a>, colors, and so on.</p>
    <p>So if <em>list</em> where [’apple’, ‘pear’, ‘banana’], the commands in the for-loop would be
    executed three times, with <em>variable</em> consecutively being <em>apple</em> the first time,
    <em>pear</em> the second time, and <em>banana</em> the third time. Now we’re counting fruit.</p>
<pre>
<span class="k">for</span> i <span class="ow">in</span> [<span class="s">"apple"</span>, <span class="s">"pear"</span>, <span class="s">"banana"</span>]:
  <span class="k">print</span> i
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> apple
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pear
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> banana
</pre>

    <p>A common thing to put here as <em>list</em> is the <strong>range(<em>n</em>)</strong>
    command, which returns a list with numbers from 0 to <em>n</em>.</p>
<pre>
<span class="k">for</span> i <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span>(<span class="mi">3</span>):
    <span class="k">print</span> i
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</pre>

    <h2>The <em>do stuff</em> part</h2>

    <p>The <em>do stuff</em> part are the PlotDevice commands that need to be executed repeatedly.
    They go indented (or tabbed) beneath the for-statement. The script is ‘trapped’ in a loop here,
    keeps executing the indented commands until each element from <em>list</em> has consecutively
    been assigned to <em>variable</em>.</p>
    <p>The great thing is you can (of course) use the <em>variable</em> in each loop. Like in the
    example above, where we had a little loop that went through all the fruit in the list and
    printed out each piece of fruit. The <em>print i</em> is an abstract command... when PlotDevice
    goes through the loop <em>i</em> is replaced with each element in the list.</p>
    <p>Don’t forget the little <strong>colon at the end</strong> of the <em>for variable in
    list:</em> statement!</p>
    <h2>For-loops and random()</h2>

    <p>For-loops and the random() work really well together. You can draw a hundred circles for
    example, and have PlotDevice place each of them at random locations. This way, each time you
    run the script, you get a different composition of circles.</p>
    <p>It’s easy to program a ‘style’ with variations this way.</p>
<pre>
<span class="k">for</span> i <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span>(<span class="mi">100</span>):
    x <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">random</span>(<span class="kc">HEIGHT</span>)
    y <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">random</span>(<span class="kc">WIDTH</span>)
    r <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">random</span>(<span class="mi">50</span>, <span class="mi">100</span>)
    <span class="nf">oval</span>(x, y, r, r)
</pre>
